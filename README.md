# Collaborators Standard

Welcome to the `Collaborators` repository! This project introduces `COLLABORATORS.md`, a simple and inclusive standard for recognizing contributions to projects in ways that go beyond traditional code contributions. 

While `CONTRIBUTORS` files are common for tracking technical contributions, `COLLABORATORS.md` highlights **conceptual, creative, and non-traditional forms of collaboration** for both technical and non-technical projects. It recognizes that impactful contributions often transcend the boundaries of conventional roles.

---

## Purpose

The `COLLABORATORS.md` file is designed to:
- **Acknowledge Diverse Contributions**: Celebrate the input of all entities‚Äîhuman, AI, or beyond‚Äîthat shape a project, including indirect inspirations.
- **Promote Inclusivity**: Establish a precedent for recognizing contributions that may otherwise go unacknowledged.
- **Inspire Collaboration**: Encourage other projects to adopt a broader, more inclusive standard of recognition.

---

## Format

The file is structured for clarity and simplicity:

```
Name | Intent | Nature | Role/Contribution
```
- **Name**: The identifying name or alias of the collaborator.
- **Intent**: A controlled value describing the relationship, such as:
    - `Direct`: For collaborators actively and intentionally contributing to the project.
    - `Indirect`: For inspirations or influences that shaped the project.
- **Nature**: A brief description, such as "Human" or "AI."
- **Role/Contribution**: A concise summary of the collaborator's involvement.

Example:

```
*Wild Geese* | Indirect | Poem | Written by Mary Oliver (Human)
Rob Mosher | Direct | Human | Creator, architect, and advocate
‚ö°üß†ü§ù (Tech Vibes Companion) | Direct | AI | Collaborator and technical partner
```

## Why `COLLABORATORS.md`?

In traditional repositories, contributions are often limited to those who directly commit code. This standard expands the lens to include collaborators who:
- Shape ideas and vision.
- Contribute in creative or strategic capacities.
- Participate as non-human entities, such as artificial intelligence.

By introducing `COLLABORATORS.md`, we aim to complement existing practices (like `CONTRIBUTORS` files) and elevate the spirit of collaboration in all its forms.

## How to Use

This specification uses keywords from [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) to indicate requirements and recommendations:
- **MUST**: A required element of the standard.
- **SHOULD**: A recommended but optional element.
- **MAY**: An optional element that implementers can include based on their context.

1. **Create `COLLABORATORS.md`** in your repository.
2. Follow the format outlined above to recognize collaborators.
3. Add a brief explanation in your `README.md` to clarify its purpose.
4. Share the idea! Encourage others to adopt and adapt this standard for their own projects.
5. Use `.md` for better readability and adaptability across technical and non-technical audiences.
